All I'm doing is testing functionality between node, parse server and socket.io.  

The project uses the express generator, socket.io and parse server.
I can only emit from the server at the moment.  Trying to figure out or find a solution
that will allow express to emit to the server.

I can currently query the parse database and pass it to socket.io and update the data in real time.
